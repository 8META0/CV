    My earliest memories are filled with curiosity and creatvity. This as you can
    easily imagine has landed me in trouble quite a few times. Curiosity it seems
    is a deep yerning for understanding without the understanding of the word, no.
    There is an abesence of information that is desired. Why? Some of us during this
    human experience have a nagging feeling varrying in personal emphasis I belive of
    needed to find answers to questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I come into cantact with something interesting quite often three questions instictivly
    form in my mind. How does it work? Why was it created? How can it be better? Then
    at times fortunatly or unfortunatly my desire for understanding grabs time, energy,
    and effort by the throat. It looks them directly in their eyes and states, "You
    know the drill, you now belong to me!" Subsequently my time, energy, and effort are
     held captive until the answers manifest themselves to subdue those three once
    lingering questions. This is who I am, this is who I will always be, a person seeking
    answers.
